# Multi-Site Content Architecture Model

## Overview

Designed a scalable multi-location web architecture for healthcare networks operating across multiple cities and service lines. The objective was to create a structured system that allowed rapid expansion without sacrificing consistency, SEO integrity, or compliance readiness.



## Problem

Healthcare networks often suffer from:
- Inconsistent service page structures across locations
- Duplicated content without taxonomy control
- Unscalable blog and education systems
- Fragmented branding and page templates

As site count and content volume increased, maintenance complexity grew exponentially.



## Solution

Implemented a structured content modeling approach:

### 1. Template-Driven Page Architecture
- Standardized service page layout across all locations
- Modular Elementor components reused system-wide
- Defined consistent section hierarchy (Overview, Conditions, Treatments, CTA)

### 2. Taxonomy + SEO Structure
- Controlled service category hierarchy
- URL structure normalization
- Internal linking framework across locations
- Structured blog tagging and category segmentation

### 3. Location-Based Content Modeling
- Shared service templates with location-specific overrides
- Centralized blog system with cross-location discoverability
- Reusable structured components for provider pages



## Scalability Outcomes

- Supported 80+ structured service pages per network
- Enabled addition of new locations without template rebuild
- Reduced content duplication issues
- Improved maintainability across practices



## Architectural Principles

- Treat pages as components, not static documents
- Separate structure from content
- Prioritize template reusability
- Design for expansion from day one
