# Form Workflow & Lead Capture Architecture

## Overview

Developed structured form workflows using Formstack integrated with GTM and analytics tracking to support patient acquisition and referral pipelines.



## Workflow Design Goals

- Structured intake across multiple service lines
- Minimize friction while preserving required data
- Support compliance requirements
- Enable measurable conversion tracking



## Architecture

### 1. Structured Form Templates
- Service-specific intake forms
- Referral workflow forms
- General contact forms
- Embedded and standalone deployment

### 2. Analytics Integration
- Event tracking on submit
- Abandonment monitoring
- Conditional logic event segmentation

### 3. Compliance Controls
- Consent validation
- Data handling safeguards
- Controlled script loading



## Optimization Strategy

- Reduced form complexity where possible
- Implemented conditional logic to improve completion rates
- Monitored conversion metrics for refinement



## Systems Perspective

Forms were treated as conversion pipelines, not just data capture tools.
