# Systems Thinking in Web Engineering

I approach web platforms as distributed systems.

Every page, form, analytics trigger, and consent control is part of an interconnected architecture.

Instead of asking:

"How do I build this page?"

I ask:

"How does this scale across 10 locations? 100 pages? 3 years of growth?"



## My Systems Principles

- Structure > aesthetics
- Reusability > duplication
- Compliance-aware engineering
- Analytics built into architecture
- Performance as a first-class concern



## Outcome

This mindset allowed me to support:

- Multi-location healthcare networks
- Content-heavy service platforms
- Compliance-aware marketing systems
- Boutique service brand websites

All built to evolve — not stagnate.
