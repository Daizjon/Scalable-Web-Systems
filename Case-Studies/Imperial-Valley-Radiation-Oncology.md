**Type:** Regional Radiation Oncology Platform  
**CMS:** WordPress + Elementor  
**Industry:** Healthcare / Oncology  



## Overview

Imperial Valley Radiation Oncology is a California-based regional cancer treatment center delivering structured radiation oncology services and comprehensive patient education.

This platform was originally part of a combined regional oncology deployment and later separated into an independent digital property while preserving architectural consistency, SEO integrity, and workflow continuity.

The project demonstrates scalable template reuse, structured entity-level deployment, and clean separation strategy within a shared healthcare web architecture.



## Scale

- ~34 Pages  
- ~118 Blog Posts  
- Multi-service treatment structure  
- Regional location-focused architecture  



## Objectives

- Provide clear radiation oncology service education
- Improve local SEO visibility within the Imperial Valley region
- Maintain patient-first navigation and accessibility
- Separate from shared regional deployment without losing structural integrity
- Preserve performance, URL equity, and metadata continuity during transition



## Architecture Highlights

### 1. Modular Treatment Page System

### 4. Entity Separation & Continuity Strategy

- Extracted from previously combined regional oncology platform
- Maintained shared modular template system
- Preserved URL structure where possible
- Ensured SEO continuity during separation
- Prevented duplication issues through controlled component reuse
- Avoided content cannibalization between split entities



## Systems Perspective

Imperial Valley Radiation Oncology represents a regional deployment built from a shared architectural foundation.

The platform demonstrates how modular web systems can be separated into independent entities without sacrificing structural integrity, SEO performance, or workflow continuity.

Rather than rebuilding from scratch, the system was carefully partitioned and redeployed — reflecting scalable healthcare platform engineering rather than isolated site development.
