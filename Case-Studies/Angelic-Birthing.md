**URL:** https://angelicbirthing.com/  
**Type:** Boutique Service Website  
**CMS:** WordPress + Elementor  
**Industry:** Maternal Health / Doula Services  



## Overview

Angelic Birthing is a Tennessee-based doula services platform designed to communicate warmth, trust, and emotional support throughout the birth journey.

Unlike large healthcare systems, this project focused on intimate brand storytelling, service clarity, and conversion-centered design tailored to a small, relationship-driven business model.

This build demonstrates the ability to adapt architectural thinking to a softer, brand-first environment while maintaining performance, structure, and scalability.
