# South Bay Radiation Oncology  
Regional Oncology Platform  
Live Site: https://southbayro.com/



## Overview

South Bay Radiation Oncology is a California-based regional cancer treatment center affiliated with UC San Diego Health Physician Network.

The platform was originally part of a combined oncology site and later separated into its own independent digital property while maintaining architectural consistency and structural integrity.

This project demonstrates scalable template reuse, content restructuring, and entity-level platform separation.



## Platform Type

Single-Location Radiation Oncology Center  
Post-Split Network Deployment



## My Role
Lead Web Developer / Systems Architect  

- Content migration and restructuring  
- Template reuse and adaptation  
- Service taxonomy alignment  
- SEO framework continuity  
- Analytics + consent configuration  
- Ongoing content expansion and maintenance  



## Architecture Highlights

### 1. Platform Separation Strategy

- Split from previously combined oncology site  
- Maintained consistent template system  
- Preserved structured URL hierarchy  
- Ensured SEO continuity during transition  



### 2. Structured Treatment Modeling

- Radiation oncology service hierarchy  
- Treatment-specific subpages  
- Blog integration aligned with service taxonomy  
- Internal linking structured around care pathways  



### 3. Template Reuse Across Entities

- Shared modular Elementor components  
- Brand-consistent but entity-specific deployment  
- Controlled content differentiation  
- Reusable system without duplication chaos  



## Technical Implementation

- WordPress + Elementor modular architecture  
- Structured URL model  
- GTM integration with consent gating  
- Form-based intake workflows  
- Performance-conscious implementation  



## Scale Indicators

- 37 structured production pages  
- 120 educational blog posts  
- Independent entity deployment from shared architecture  
- Modular template reuse across regional oncology centers  



## Outcomes

- Successful site separation without structural degradation  
- Maintained SEO integrity across entity split  
- Reduced rebuild effort through component reuse  
- Preserved brand alignment while supporting independent identity  



## Systems Perspective

South Bay Radiation Oncology represents a scalable entity-level deployment built from shared architectural foundations.

This case demonstrates how modular web systems can support multiple regional healthcare centers while maintaining structural integrity, SEO continuity, and workflow clarity.
