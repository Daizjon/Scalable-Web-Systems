Live Site: https://petimaging.us/



## Overview

PET Imaging is a multi-state specialty imaging network operating across Texas, Colorado, and Oklahoma.

The platform supports structured imaging service presentation, referring physician workflows, and patient acquisition across geographically distributed locations.

Unlike a single-location diagnostic site, this system was architected as a scalable imaging services network with centralized governance.
